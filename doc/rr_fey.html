  <!-- ================== Component Summary ================== -->
  <h2><a id="Component_summary">Component summary</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>This component brings all fey creatures in the game closer to their <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> counterparts. Legitimately missing abilities are restored and spuriously granted benefits are removed. For this purpose, the AD&amp;D Monstrous Manual and the Monstrous Compendium were used as reference. The creatures' <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> has been improved as well, and it now allows them to act in accordance to the behavior described in the source books. In effect, these changes may slightly increase the difficulty of dealing with fey creatures.</p>
  </div>


  
  <!-- ================== Fey creatures By Type ================== -->
  <h2><a id="Fey_creatures_by_type">Fey creatures by type</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Fey are magical creatures with a strong connection to nature. Their actions are strange and seemingly without reason at times. Logic has little if any place in their decision-making processes, if emotion tells them otherwise. They do what they feel like doing at the moment, even if they know it might bring about poor results. Fey are usually humanoid in appearance. Many of them posses spell-like abilities and other magical traits.</p>

  <!-- ================== Spell and Abilities ================== -->
  <h2><a id="Fey_spell-like_abilities_and_special">Fey spell-like abilities and special traits</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>As per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> rules, Fey creatures cannot be interrupted while using their spell-like abilities, all of which have a casting time of 1. In all other aspects, spell-like abilities function exactly like the spells which they mimic.</p>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Animal_Friendship">Animal Friendship</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      By means of this spell, the caster is able to show an animal that he seeks its friendship. If the animal fails a saving throw vs. spell, it will regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected during the next 5 turns. If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the animal by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the animal, the spell is broken.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Blinding_Beauty">Blinding Beauty</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet of the Nymph. Those who look directly at her must save vs. spells or become blinded for 24 hours. The Nymph's allies are unaffected by this ability. Furthermore, if the Nymph is invisible and/or if her opponents cannot see her, this ability will not affect them.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Charming_Song">Charming Song</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      Upon hearing a Sirine's song, all humanoids within 30 feet must save vs. spell or become charmed for 2 turns. Creatures that have been deafened (i.e. by the Deafness spell) are not subject to the song. Similarly, Sirines that have been magically silenced (i.e. by the Silence 15' Radius spell) cannot sing.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Detect_Snares_and_Pits">Detect Snares and Pits</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      This spell grants the caster the ability to detect snares, pits, deadfalls and similar natural hazards. A single casting of the spell will reveal all traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster during the following 10 rounds. This spell only functions in natural surroundings.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Fog_Cloud">Fog Cloud</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      This spell creates a fog of any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot cube per caster level. The fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond 2 feet. The fog persists for 1 turn. A Gust of Wind or a Zone of Sweet Air spell will disperse the fog. Walking out of the spell's area of effect will also restore normal vision.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Speak_With_Plants">Speak With Plants</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      This spell allows the caster to converse with plants and to exercise limited control over them. Creatures entwined by an Entangle spell can be released (even if the spell was cast by an opponent) and are protected from all subsequent entangle effects for 1 turn. Furthermore, by communicating her intent to nearby plants, the caster can prevent her own Entangle spell from affecting her allies - this ability is always active.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Touch_of_Tranquility">Touch of Tranquility</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      If a Sirine touches an opponent, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or have his intelligence reduced to 2, effectively becoming feebleminded. The touch is automatic for charmed individuals, but requires a normal attack roll for others. A successful dispel magic will restore the victim's intelligence and negate the feeblemindedness.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Wild_Empathy">Wild Empathy</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      Fey creatures have a natural affinity for handling wild animals. Unless provoked, wild animals will never deliberately attack a fey creature.
    </div>
  </div>



  <!-- ================== Encounters ================== -->
  <h2><a id="More_sensible_fey_creature_encounters">More sensible fey creature encounters</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>This part of the component slightly alters the placement of fey creatures in certain areas in order to provide a more immersive gameplay experience. Here's the full list of changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AR0315 (Windsper Hills) - Vaelasa, the Fairy Queen is now treated as a Hamadryad and summons two Dryads (instead of Sirines) if attacked</li>
      <li>AR1500 (Spellhold, outside) - randomly spawning Lizardmen and Mists have been replaced with 1-5 Sirines (the number is based on the game difficulty setting and the party's XP)</li>
      <li>AR8500, FW1700 (Cloakwood, fourth main area) - The lone Hamadryad gets a few allies: 2 Cave Bears and 4 Dire Wolves</li>
      <li>AR9500, FW3600 (Lighthouse) - Sil, the Sirine near the Flesh Golem cave now has 7 Hit Dice</li>
    </ul>
  </div>



  <!-- ================== Compatibility ================== -->
  <h2><a id="Compatibility">Compatibility</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ul>
      <li>The PnP Fey creatures component uses Detectable Spells and is therefore incompatible with the Improved Anvil mod</li>
      <li>In order to achieve optimal compatibility with Sword Coast Stratagems I &amp; II, Spell Revisions, Tactics and Big Picture, you should install aTweaks after those mods.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>



  <!-- ================== Known Issues ================== -->
  <h2><a id="Known_Issues">Known Issues</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ul>
      <li>The Speak With Plants spell-like ability cannot release creatures from entanglement before the current round ends</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
