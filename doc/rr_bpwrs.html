  <!-- ================== Revised Bhaalpowers ================== -->
  <h2><a id="Revised_Bhaalpowers">Revised Bhaalpowers</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>This component revises the Bhaalpowers which the Protagonist receives in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym> (or at the start of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2">BG2</acronym>) due to his divine heritage. The general goal was to retain the basic roles which the Bhaalpowers had in the original game while simultaneously making them scale a bit better with the Protagonist's level. In brief, this revision makes the Bhaalpowers slightly more useful and unique without making them too overpowered. It will also affect the Bhaalpowers which Imoen receives in ToB.</p>
  
    <!-- ================== Good Bhaalpowers ================== -->
    <div class="subsection">
      <object><h3><a id="Good_Bhaalpowers">Good Bhaalpowers</a></h3></object>
      <p>The following Bhaalpowers are awarded to characters who have a reputation above 9 after certain Chapters in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym> and characters to whose alignment isn't Chaotic Evil at the start of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2">BG2</acronym>.</p>


      <span class="item-title"><a id="Healing_Touch">Healing Touch</a></span> <i>(was Cure Light Wounds)</i>
      <div class="item">
	<b>Range:</b> Touch<br />
	<b>Duration:</b> Permanent<br />
	<b>Casting Time:</b> 1<br />
	<b>Area of Effect:</b> 1 creature<br />
	<b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br />
	<p>By laying his hand upon a living creature, the Bhaalspawn can channel positive energy which cures 5 points of damage +1 point per level (up to a maximum of 25). This ability has no effect on constructs, undead or extraplanar creatures.</p>
      </div>


      <span class="item-title"><a id="Cure_Affliction">Cure Affliction</a></span><i> (was Slow Poison)</i>
      <div class="item">

	<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br />
	<b>Casting Time:</b> 1<br />
	<b>Area of Effect:</b> 1 creature<br />
	<b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br />
	<p>By a simple touch, the Bhaalspawn can lift an affliction from a single living creature. The potency of this ability increases as the Bhaalspawn becomes more experienced:</p>
	<p>Level 1: cures poison<br />Level 6: cures poison and disease<br />Level 12: cures poison, disease, blindness and deafness<br />Level 18: cures poison, disease, blindness, deafness and feeblemind</p>

      </div>


      <span class="item-title"><a id="Divine_Might">Divine Might</a></span> <i>(was Draw Upon Holy Might)</i>
      <div class="item">

	<b>Duration:</b> 1 turn<br />
	<b>Casting Time:</b> 1<br />
	<b>Area of Effect:</b> Caster<br />
	<b>Saving Throw:</b> None <br />
	<p>Through this ability, the Bhaalspawn can tap into the divine spark buried deep within his soul and gain a burst of power for a short time period. The Bhaalspawn's strength, constitution and dexterity scores are all raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of experience.</p>
	<p><i>(Note: this ability is essentially unchanged from the unmodded game. Only the name was altered.)</i></p>

    <!-- ================== Evil Bhaalpowers ================== -->
    <div class="subsection">
      <object><h3><a id="Evil_Bhaalpowers">Evil Bhaalpowers</a></h3></object>
      <p>The following Bhaalpowers are awarded to characters who have a reputation below 10 after certain Chapters in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym> and to characters whose alignment isn't Lawful Good at the start of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2">BG2</acronym>.</p>


      <span class="item-title"><a id="Drain_Life"></a>Drain Life</span> <i>(was Larloch's Minor Drain)</i>
      <div class="item">
	<b>Range:</b> Sight of Caster<br />
	<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br />
	<b>Casting Time:</b> 1<br />
	<b>Area of Effect:</b> 1 creature<br />
	<b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br />
	<p>Through this ability the Bhaalspawn can drain 5 hit points of life energy +1 point per every two experience levels (up to a maximum of 15) from a single living creature within his line of sight. If the Bhaalspawn exceeds his maximum hit point total in the process, he loses them after 10 rounds have passed. This ability has no effect on constructs, undead or extraplanar creatures.</p>
      </div>


      <span class="item-title"><a id="Cause_Affliction">Cause Affliction</a></span> <i>(was Horror)</i>
      <div class="item">
	<b>Range:</b> Touch<br />
	<b>Duration:</b> Special<br />
	<b>Casting Time:</b> 1<br />
	<b>Area of Effect:</b> 1 creature<br />
	<b>Saving Throw:</b> Neg.<br />
	<p>By a simple touch, the Bhaalspawn can bestow an affliction upon a single living creature unless it makes a saving throw vs. death. The potency of this ability increases as the Bhaalspawn becomes more experienced:</p>
	<p>Level 1: the target is poisoned (taking 5 hit points of damage + 1 per every two levels of the Bhaalspawn, up to a maximum of 15)<br />Level 6: the target is poisoned and diseased (taking a 2 point penalty to its strength and constitution scores)<br />Level 12: the target is poisoned, diseased, blinded and deafened<br />Level 18: the target is poisoned, diseased, blinded, deafened and feebleminded</p>
	<p>This ability has no effect on constructs, undead or extraplanar creatures.</p>
      </div>


      <span class="item-title"><a id="Divine_Wrath">Divine Wrath</a></span> <i>(was Vampiric Touch)</i>
      <div class="item">
	<b>Range:</b> Caster<br />
	<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br />
	<b>Casting Time:</b> 1<br />
	<b>Area of Effect:</b> 10' radius<br />
	<b>Saving Throw:</b> Special<br />
	<p>Through this ability, the Bhaalspawn can tap into the divine spark buried deep within his soul and release a portion of the raw power in a single, concentrated burst. The unleashed energy damages all enemies in the immediate vicinity of the Bhaalspawn and has a chance to push them away, knock them prone and make them flee in panic. The potency of this ability increases as the Bhaalspawn becomes more experienced:</p>
	<p>Level 1: deals 2d8 damage to all nearby enemies<br />Level 6: deals 4d8 damage to all nearby enemies pushing them away from the Bhaalspawn<br />Level 12: deals 6d8 damage to all nearby enemies pushing them away from the Bhaalspawn and knocking them prone for 1 round<br />Level 18: deals 8d8 damage to all nearby enemies pushing them away from the Bhaalspawn, knocking them prone for 1 round and making them flee in panic for the following 3 rounds</p>
	<p>A successful saving throw vs. breath halves the damage and negates all secondary effects. Exceptionally large creatures (Giants, Dragons, Iron Golems...etc.) are immune to all secondary effects.</p>
