  <h2><a id="PnP_Fiends"><acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym></a> Fiends</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>This component brings all Fiends in the game closer to their <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> counterparts. Legitimately missing abilities are restored and spuriously granted benefits are removed. The Fiends' <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> has been enhanced as well, and it now allows them to act in accordance to their <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> behavior and intelligence scores. In effect, these changes moderately increase the difficulty of dealing with Fiend opponents. Finally, the Blood War now plays a slightly more prominent role. Whenever Baatezu and Tanar'ri meet, they will taunt and fight each other. This will take precedence over any other actions unless the Fiends' existence is endangered by a more powerful enemy.</p>

    <div class="subsection">
      <object><h3><a id="Baatezu">Baatezu</a></h3></object>
      <p>The Baatezu are a strong, evil-tempered, well-organized race of fiends. In their rigid caste system, authority derives not only from power but from station. As Lawful Evil beings, the Baatezu pursue calculated doctrines as part of a grand plan to advance their race to dominion of all the planes. They tempt mortals into intellectual evils such as pride, ambition, and subversion. The primary goal of the Baatezu is to destroy their ancient enemies, the Tanar'ri. Both races are engaged in an eternal conflict known as the Blood War. According to their rank, the Baatezu are divided into three groups: least, lesser and greater.</p>

      <p>Like the Baatezu, Tanar'ri are also fiends, but they embody evil of a different type. Chaotic Evil personified, the Tanar'ri are motivated not by doctrines but by insane, violent inner drives. They tempt mortals into crimes of passion and vice, evils of appetite. The primary goal of the Tanar'ri is to destroy their ancient enemies, the Baatezu. Both races are engaged in an eternal conflict known as the Blood War. According to their rank, there are five classifications of Tanar'ri, listed in ascending order of power: least, lesser, greater, true and guardian.</p>

      <p>The Yugoloth are fiends that inhabit the Lower Planes of Acheron, Gehenna, the Grey Wastes and Carceri. While the Baatezu and the Tanar'ri are forever bitter enemies locked in an eternal struggle, the Yugoloth play both sides against each other for their own gain. The defining characteristics of the Yugoloth are their complete lack of loyalty and their greed. They act as mercenaries in the Blood War, but continually betray the side they are currently working for in return for even greater rewards from the other side. Were it not for their fear that the other side may gain an advantage by using the Yugoloth, neither the Baatezu nor the Tanar'ri would enlist their services. By their power alone are Yugoloth divided into two categories: lesser and greater.</p>

  <h2><a id="New_abilities"></a>New items, special traits and spell-like abilities</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>As per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> rules, Fiends cannot be interrupted while using their spell-like abilities, all of which have a casting time of 1. Furthermore, Fiends no longer automatically see through Invisibility unless that's explicitly stated in their statistic block. Finally, as creatures of extraplanar origin, Fiends do not benefit from curative magic. Here are the descriptions of the Fiends' unique items, special traits and spell-like abilities which don't have a spell counterpart in the unmodded game:</p>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Aura_of_Fear">Aura of Fear</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      The mere presence of certain Fiends is so terrifying that they radiate an aura of fear. Once per three rounds, all opponents within the Fiend's visual range must save versus rod, staff, or wand at flee in panic for 3 rounds. Pit Fiends, the highest ranking of all Baatezu, radiate an exceptionally powerful aura of fear. Opponents facing them make their saves with a -3 penalty. Other Fiends, Constructs, Slimes and Undead creatures are completely unaffected by this aura.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Aura_of_Paralysis">Aura of Paralysis</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      Any living creature coming within 10 feet of a Nabassu must save vs. paralyzation or become paralyzed for 5 rounds. This ability can only be used once per encounter. Other Fiends, Constructs, Slimes and Undead creatures are completely unaffected by this aura.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Body_Flames">Body Flames</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      The body of a Balor is constantly wreathed in searing flames. Anyone attempting to strike the Fiend in melee suffers 4d6 points of fire damage. The intense flames will now burn through webs and any entangling vegetation. They will also repel insects and bat swarms and also allow Balors to finish off Trolls that have been knocked down by merely walking over them.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Cause_Disease">Cause Disease</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      With this spell the caster afflicts the target with a vile fever. The victim's Strength is lowered by 1 point, plus 1 additional point for every 5 levels of the caster, for a maximum of 5 points at level 20. Additionally, the victim is fatigued and suffers 1 point of damage per round. The victim can save vs. spell to avoid all the effects. The disease does not end before the death of the victim unless magically cured.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Cause_Fear">Cause Fear</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      This spell causes one creature to flee in panic for 3 rounds unless a saving throw vs. spells is made. Fiends, Constructs, Slimes and Undead creatures are unaffected by fear.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Color_Spray"></a>Color Spray</span>
    <div class="item">
      Upon the casting of this spell, a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors spring forth in front of the caster. All creatures in the area of effect are entitled a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects, if they are above the 6th level or above the level of the caster. Blind or unseeing creatures are not affected. Creatures that are not allowed a saving throw, or that fail their saving throw, and whose level is below or equal to the level of the caster are struck unconscious that are 3 or more levels above the level of the caster are disoriented and unable to think or act coherently for 1 round.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Curse">Curse</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      When the Curse spell is uttered, the caster lowers the morale of enemy creatures and penalizes their attack and damage rolls by 1. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Death_Gaze">Death Gaze</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      Once per day, a Nabassu may use its Death Gaze on a single humanoid opponent within its visual range. This ability forces the target to save vs. spell or transform into a Ghast after 5 rounds have passed. Killing the Nabassu before that, or casting a Remove Curse spell on the victim negates the effect. Once the target transforms into a Ghast, the process becomes irrevocable, and the victim forevermore remains under the complete control of the Nabassu.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Death_Throes">Death Throes</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      A Balor slain in the Abyss explodes in a brilliant flash of light inflicting 50 points of fire damage to everyone nearby. A successful saving throw vs. spells halves the damage. Note: in gameplay terms, this only applies to a few areas: the Abyssal pocket inside the Planar Sphere, Hell (Irenicus' final battle stage), the Protagonist's Pocket Plane and the Throne of Bhaal (Mellisan's final battle stage).
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Drain_Life">Drain Life</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      Alu-Fiends can restore their own bit points at the expense of their opponents. This requires a melee touch attack which deals 1d8 points of damage, of which the Alu-Fiend gets half, rounded up.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Etherealness">Etherealness</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      This ability allows a Fiend to temporarily enter the Ethereal Plane, which has several side effects. Firstly, the Fiend effectively becomes invisible to observers on the Prime Material Plane, though its presence may be revealed by Detect Invisibility, True Seeing and similar spells. Secondly, while ethereal, a Fiend cannot be harmed by physical nor magical attacks, however, it cannot interact with objects and creatures on the Prime Material Plane either. Thirdly, Fiends who possess innate regeneration regain lost hit points at a faster rate while ethereal, due to the different flow of time on the Ethereal Plane. Lastly, a Fiend may remain ethereal up to 1 hour/level, though it can exit the Ethereal Plane at any time before that, if it desires to.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Extraplanar_Traits">Extraplanar Traits</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      Extraplanar creatures are immune to Death Spell and are unaffected by all Cure and Cause Wound spells.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Fear">Fear</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      When this spell is invoked, the caster sends forth an invisible cone of terror which causes creatures within its area of effect to save vs. spells or turn away from the caster and flee in panic for 1 round per level of the caster. Fiends, Constructs, Slimes and Undead creatures are unaffected by fear.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Gaze_of_Fascination">Gaze of Fascination</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      Any humanoid that meets the gaze of an Ultroloth must save vs. spell or stop fascinated (as if affected by a Hold Person spell), watching the coursing colors and patterns.
    </div>


    <span class="item-title"><a id="Hover">Hover</a></span>
    <div class="item">
      This ability is available to a creature that can fly with either perfect or near perfect maneuverability. The creature can halt its movement while flying, allowing it to hover. This effectively prevents ground-based spells such as Earthquake, Entangle, Grease and Web from affecting the creature. Furthermore, creatures with this ability can cross lava and acid pools without taking damage by hovering above them.
      <!-- Note: this ability should not be automatically given to all creatures that have fly movement (Fl). Instead, it should be given to creatures who have either perfect or near perfect flight maneuverability (class A or B). -->

  <h2><a id="Altered_Spells">Altered Spells</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Several aspects of the Fiend summoning process are altered. Firstly, while summoned Fiends still remain uncontrollable, they now match the allegiance of their summoner. This allows the summoner to receive experience points for each opponent that the Fiends defeats, but it also applies the appropriate reputation penalty for each innocent that the Fiend murders. Note: certain Fiends prefers to trick and manipulate innocents into service, rather than killing them outright. Secondly, the nature of a summoned Fiend now corresponds to the alignment of its summoner. A Baatezu appears if the caster is lawfully aligned, while a Tanar'ri appears if the caster is chaotically aligned. If the caster is neither lawfully nor chaotically aligned, a Yugoloth will be summoned instead. Finally, the party now gains <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> for killing Fiends summoned by opponents. Summoned fiends of the same type will attempt to coordinate their attacks. When one fiend encounters an enemy, it will try to alert any nearby fiends of its type to the enemy's presence. For example, if a summoned Nabassu encounters an opponent it will alert any summoned Tanar'ri fiends that may be nearby. Here are the updated descriptions of the revised Fiend summoning spells:</p>

  <h2><a id="More_sensible_fiend_encounters">More sensible fiend encounters</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>This part of PnP Fiends slightly alters the placement of fiends in certain areas in order to provide a more immersive gameplay experience. Here's the full list of changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AR0414 (Planar Sphere, Demon Plane) - Lea'liyl is now treated as a Marilith, one of the two generic Tanar'ri becomes a Glabrezu while the other remains a Nabassu. Some previously unused dialogue lines for Lea'liyl and the Nabassu have also been restored. Furthermore, several Imps have been replaced with Quasits</li>
      <li>AR0906 (Guarded Compound 1st Floor) - the Glabrezu encountered here is no longer hostile towards the other monsters in the room</li>
      <li>AR1512 (Spellhold Maze, 1st level) - The Pit Fiend summoned through the portal can no longer be attacked before the gating animation is complete</li>
      <li>AR6105 (Sendai's Lair, near Diaytha) - The Abishai and the Demon Knight are replaced with a Glabrezu and a Balor</li>
