@248 = ~Healing Touch
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By laying <PRO_HISHER> hand upon a living creature, the Bhaalspawn can channel positive energy which cures 5 points of damage +1 point per level (up to a maximum of 25). This ability has no effect on constructs, undead or extraplanar creatures.~
@249 = ~Drain Life
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Through this ability the Bhaalspawn can drain 5 hit points of life energy +1 point per every two experience levels (up to a maximum of 15) from a single living creature within <PRO_HISHER> line of sight. If the Bhaalspawn exceeds <PRO_HISHER> maximum hit point total in the process, <PRO_HESHE> loses them after 10 rounds have passed. This ability has no effect on constructs, undead or extraplanar creatures.~
@250 = ~Cure Affliction
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By a simple touch, the Bhaalspawn can lift an affliction from a single living creature. The potency of this ability increases as the Bhaalspawn becomes more experienced:

Level 1: cures poison
Level 6: cures poison and disease
Level 12: cures poison, disease, blindness and deafness
Level 18: cures poison, disease, blindness, deafness and feeblemind

This ability has no effect on constructs, undead or extraplanar creatures.~
@251 = ~Cause Affliction
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

By a simple touch, the Bhaalspawn can bestow an affliction upon a single living creature unless it makes a saving throw vs. death. The potency of this ability increases as the Bhaalspawn becomes more experienced:

Level 1: the target is poisoned (taking 5 hit points of damage + 1 per every two levels of the Bhaalspawn, up to a maximum of 15)
Level 6: the target is poisoned and diseased (taking a 2 point penalty to its strength and constitution scores)
Level 12: the target is poisoned, diseased, blinded and deafened
Level 18: the target is poisoned, diseased, blinded, deafened and feebleminded

This ability has no effect on constructs, undead or extraplanar creatures.~
@252 = ~Divine Might
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Through this ability, the Bhaalspawn can tap into the divine spark buried deep within <PRO_HISHER> soul and gain a burst of power for a short time period. The Bhaalspawn's strength, constitution and dexterity scores are all raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of experience.~
@253 = ~Divine Wrath
Range: Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: Special

Through this ability, the Bhaalspawn can tap into the divine spark buried deep within <PRO_HISHER> soul and release a portion of the raw power in a single, concentrated burst. The unleashed energy damages all enemies in the immediate vicinity of the Bhaalspawn and has a chance to push them away, knock them prone and make them flee in panic. The potency of this ability increases as the Bhaalspawn becomes more experienced:

Level 1: deals 2d8 damage to all nearby enemies
Level 6: deals 4d8 damage to all nearby enemies, pushing them away from the Bhaalspawn
Level 12: deals 6d8 damage to all nearby enemies, pushing them away from the Bhaalspawn and knocking them prone for 1 round
Level 18: deals 8d8 damage to all nearby enemies, pushing them away from the Bhaalspawn, knocking them prone for 1 round and making them flee in panic for the following 3 rounds

A successful saving throw vs. breath halves the damage and negates all secondary effects. Exceptionally large creatures (Giants, Dragons, Iron Golems...etc.) are immune to all secondary effects.~

@749 = ~Elminster's Ecologies: Appendix IIIa

This time-worn tome is written by the sage Elminster, and apparently part of a much larger body of work containing detailed studies of most of the strange creatures from around Faerun.

The appendix seems to refer to newly-discovered variations on normal breeds of creatures.  Of particular interest:

"Dense Puddings - a relative of the slimes and molds, this pudding is relatively normal...except when exposed to electricity or fire.  When this occurs, it splits into new puddings and can therefore be very dangerous."

"Fire Trolls - a new form of troll thought to have been created by sorcerous Fire Giants for use as servants and guards.  They are similar to regular trolls in most respects except for their lava-temperature skin and burning touch.  Once they are defeated, they can only be permanently killed by cold or acid."

"Fission Slime - an off-shoot of the slimes and molds, this particular slime will split into new and independent creatures when hit.  It is vulnerable to fire, which will kill it permanently."

"Magic Golems - this rare type of golem is formed from pure magical energy and is completely immune to spellcraft as well as enchanted weapons.  To my knowledge, only weapons without enchantments have any effects on this creature."

"Mariliths - while this is apparently a legitimate form of demon, it is one that only an exceptional few have encountered and survived.  The Marilith is a six-armed demon with a human female front half and the back half of a snake.  She is incredibly quick and deadly, and on top of her martial prowess with six swords, she casts spells as well.  Fighters should beware: this demon is immune to normal weapons and minor enchantments."~

@2200 = ~Conjure Fire Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 6
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a conjure fire elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the elemental plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster.  One 12 hit dice elemental always answers the summons. Furthermore, there is a 35% chance that an additional 16 HD Greater Elemental appears and a 5% chance than an additional 20 hit dice Elder Elemental is summoned. Once the elemental appears the caster must concentrate on the creature for 3 rounds in order to assure that the elemental will not turn on him (15% chance the elemental will attack the caster).  However, after this period has passed the elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain, or the duration of the spell runs out.  All of the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature.~

However, after this period has passed the elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain, or the duration of the spell runs out.  All of the commands given to the elemental are done so telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and it is not necessary to know the language of the summoned creature.~

Range: 10 yards
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special

Lastly, pressing the 'E' key will instruct the Cleric/Paladin to heal injured party members. By default, the Cleric/Paladin will only heal allies outside of combat.
